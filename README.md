This is where we store all necessities for demultiple project, 2017 Hackathon
The project idea is to have machine : (1) identifying surface related multiples from seismic dataset (e.g. shot), tell them apart from primary signals or refraction signals (2) remove such signal from the seismic dataset, despite using conventional subtraction or modeling method.
